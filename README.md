# Data-Sturctures
Data structures are fundamental concepts in computer science and programming that define how data is organized, stored, and manipulated in a computer's memory or storage. They provide a way to efficiently store and access data, enabling various operations and algorithms to be performed effectively. Data structures can be categorized into two main types:

## Primitive Data Structures:
These are basic data types provided by programming languages, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans. They represent individual pieces of data and are used as building blocks for more complex data structures.

## Abstract Data Structures (ADTs):
Abstract data structures are higher-level data structures that are not directly implemented in most programming languages but are created using primitive data types. They define a set of operations and rules for manipulating data but do not specify how the data is actually stored or implemented. Common abstract data structures include:

### Arrays:
Ordered collections of elements with a fixed size, where each element is accessed by an index.
### Lists: 
Ordered collections of elements with dynamic sizes, often implemented as arrays or linked lists.
### Stacks: 
A linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, used for tasks like managing function calls or undo operations.
### Queues:
A linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, used for tasks like task scheduling or handling requests.
### Trees: 
Hierarchical data structures with nodes connected by edges, used for tasks like organizing data, searching, and hierarchical representation.
### Graphs: 
Collections of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect them, used for modeling complex relationships and networks.
### Hash Tables: 
Data structures that map keys to values, allowing for fast retrieval of values based on their keys.

Data structures are chosen and designed based on the specific requirements of a problem or task. The choice of data structure can significantly impact the efficiency and performance of algorithms and applications. Computer scientists and programmers study data structures to understand how to use them effectively and to design new data structures when needed.
